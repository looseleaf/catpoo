# Ideas to sort
Some ideas on structure I need to parse and document

## Layout
Layout is really about context, that is controlling the focus of the eye through visual que's (symbols and positioning).  That said, really we have 2 basic things with a webpage - view and navigation.  Complexity is really because positioning patterns are varible.... blah blah anyway I'm just going to set some rules and reasons.

### Content Context
 - Content view (center of page) - cause everybody thinks as a page.
 - Content nav (left bar) - left margin because most people are right hand, so left margin is close to the thumb they hold the device with
 - Content tools (right bar) - right because that's where your right hand is... and most people use right hand to 'modify' (colapsable content tool bar)

### Content Consume (User)
 - Consume nav (top bar) - top margin for user info, alerts people expect in the browser... and nav out of context
 - Consume view (top bar icon)
 - Consum tools (top bar icon)

### Content Comment (user communications about content with context meta-data for future consumption)
 - Comment nav (typically a touch of the content)
 - Comment view (typically activated by comment nav)
 - Comment tools (typically tools activated as context is now the comment)
